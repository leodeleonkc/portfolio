## How I worked on this project

My goal was to create a personal portfolio to showcase my developer work.

- I built this site based on my Figma designs: <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/1YmYQG7rlm7gCoiEjQioRo/My-Portfolio-Page?node-id=0%3A1">Figma File</a>
- I used GitHub desktop to for version control.

## How to navigate this project

 - Simple stateful logic: <a href="https://github.com/leodeleonkc/portfolio/blob/23b64db0c4b41e1ba9adec6b8919cab3154db453/my-app/src/components/Projects.js#L13">Sample Code</a>
 - Responsive CSS: <a href="https://github.com/leodeleonkc/portfolio/blob/23b64db0c4b41e1ba9adec6b8919cab3154db453/my-app/src/App.css">Sample Code</a>
 - useEffect animate-in on scroll: <a href="https://github.com/leodeleonkc/portfolio/blob/23b64db0c4b41e1ba9adec6b8919cab3154db453/my-app/src/components/Hero.js">Sample Code</a>
 
 ## Why I built the project this way
 
 - Afer one week of React training, I felt that I was ready to build this project. There aren't any complexities in terms of the framework that would differ all that much from a simple HTML/CSS/JS site. Any useState complexity was added later on once I had deepened my knowledge.
 
 - It was very important to me that this site was perfectly responsive, and taking into consideration the fact that it is likely being viewed on mobile and tablet a good percentage of the time, I made some creative choices around that. For example, the showcase videos for each project are purposedly produced in 1:1 ratio, which allows for more screen usage when playing the video.
 
 - I wanted to create something simple, but well made, clean and to the point. My goal is that I can showcase my skills in a compelling manner without many distractions and to make it easy for potential employers to contact me.
 
 ## If I had more time I would change this
 
 - I would definitely break up the global CSS file into component-specific files, or better yet, use styled-components.
 - I would use less CSS for certain functionality, such as the hamburger menu on mobile and use more state.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
